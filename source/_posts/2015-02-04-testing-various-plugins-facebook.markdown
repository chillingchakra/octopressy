Sadly most of the better things that pop into my head end up on Facebook, a walled off garden. Although people can "follow" your public posts, things are mostly limited to your "friends". Which is okay because most of my things have an attachment of my own personality to them and perhaps a public person which does not know me personally will take it significantly differently than a person I do personally know (Facebook "friends").

I sort of occasionally take a swing at Twitter, but I don't really care for it very much. The 140 character limit feels like enslavement by some sadist who simply doesn't want anybody to be able to rant. Nobody comes off as angry because they are limited to 140 character and as a result, no other person reading the first persons stuff is inspired by their message to cause reform of some sort. So it's mostly for humor, comedians seem to do well with it.

I like Instagram, and the community at least seems to enjoy my contributions because I take interesting photos and play around with various Photoshop tools as well as Vingnette on Android.
There isn't really a lot of interaction on Instagram though, it's just hearts and the occasional comment (seldom anything of use). It's other great use is looking at pretty chicks. Man, pretty chicks are a plenty on Instagram. I think sometimes Instagram would be an interesting bare-bones dating site experiment. I noticed a while ago that Tinder got tired of people posting their Instagram links at the bottom of their Tinder profiles and built a Instagram clone right into the Tinder app.

So some of my better stuff is on Facebook, as such, I found a neat plugin that should allow for an embed and will proceed to try it out below and then RAKE that shit.
